# Vet Clinic DB

> In this project, we will use a relational database called PostgreSQL to create the data structure for a vet clinic. We will create a complete database with data about the following entities:
  - animals
  - animals' owners
  - clinic employees
  - visits


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
